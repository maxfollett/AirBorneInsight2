  Description:
    Abstract:
      Aeromagnetic and aeroradiometric data were collected along flight lines by
      instruments in an aircraft that recorded magnetic-field and radiometric
      values and locations.  The magnetic data set presents latitude, longitude,
      altitude, and magnetic-field values.  Geologic symbols or codes are also
      included.  The geologic symbols were picked from surficial geologic maps.
      The radiometric data set presents latitude, longitude, altitude, geologic
      symbols or codes, apparent Uranium (Bismuth 214), Thorium (Thallium 208),
      and Potassium (K 40), the element ratios, and ancillary information.
    Purpose:
      Aeromagnetic surveys are used for geophysical prospecting.  Some
      variations in magnetic measurements are caused by rocks that contain
      significant amounts of magnetic minerals (magnetite being the most common).
      These anomalies reflect variations in the amount and type of magnetic
      material and the shape and depth of the body of rock.

      Aeromagnetic anomaly maps are important tools in mapping surficial and
      buried igneous rocks.  The features and patterns of aeromagnetic anomalies
      can also be used to delineate details of subsurface geology including the
      locations of buried faults and the thickness of surficial sedimentary rocks.

      Aeroradiometric surveys measure the radiation emanating from the earth's
      surface, which provides general estimates of the geographic distribution of
      uranium, thorium, and potassium in surficial and some bedrock units.
      Bismuth 214 and Thallium 208 are decay products of Uranium and Thorium.
      Along with Potassium 40 they give identifiable peaks in the gamma-ray spectra
      of naturally occurring radiation. The element data and the ratios of the
      element data are used to help map surficial geology and to detect
      concentrations of radioactive minerals.
    Supplemental_Information:
      The U.S. Department of Energy through Bendix Corp. contracted
      numerous airborne surveys over a period from 1974 to 1981 covering most
      of the conterminous United States and much of Alaska.  The primary
      purpose was to obtain airborne radiometric data in order to locate and
      evaluate uranium resources.  Aeromagnetic data were also acquired at
      the same time.  In the mid-1980's, all the NURE Program's data were
      given to the U.S. Geological Survey.  The aeromagnetic data were also
      archived at the National Geophysical Data Center. With the improvement
      in digital communication and the ability to store and transmit large
      data sets, the USGS is now able to release the flight-line data in a
      common format.

      The U.S. Geological Survey has contracted or flown numerous airborne
      surveys over a long period (1950's to present).  Much of the digital
      flight-line data have been released to the public through a companion
      DVD and a web site.  Reference is in the Cross-Reference section of
      this metadata file.

      A companion CD-ROM/web site has been released containing magnetic
      data that were generated by digitizing analog maps.  The original
      analog flight-line profiles used to create the analog maps are
      unavailable.  Reference is in the Cross-Reference section of this
      metadata file.

      CD's have been released containing the original radiometric flight-line
      data in various formats.  Reference is in the Cross-Reference section
      of this metadata file.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      The data in this file have been processed using various formulas and
      methods that are not usually documented but that represent
      industry standard practices for airborne data reduction.  For example,
      position is listed as latitude and longitude, but these values
      were derived from the raw navigation data depending on the system used.
      (see notes under horizontal accuracy). Line numbers were added to
      records, and unusable data at flight-line ends were discarded
      (as aircraft slowed and turned around). Separate recordings were
      correlated by time and assigned to the correct location.

      The exact accuracies of these processing steps may not be known.
      They are discussed in the sections on attribute or positional
      accuracies.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    The data in this file were collected by a single contractor or group
    who were responsible for collecting and processing the data.

    The data from this survey were collected using the same instruments
    (magnetometers, altimeters, radiometic crystal packages, navigational
    systems) throughout the survey and were collected in a normal length of
    time with no long delays between survey beginning and end.

    Survey contracts specified the conditions and specifications under which
    these data were collected.  Standard industry practices of the time
    were followed in data collection and processing.
  Completeness_Report:
    Loss of data due to poor transmission, channel dropout, obvious spiking,
    missing channels, and other obvious errors were replaced with one of the
    Following values: -9999.9, -999.9, -99, etc.  Sometimes channels were
    added and filled with dummy values (-9999.9, etc.) to comply with the
    established format.  Records that had no usable data were deleted.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        Flight Path Recovery

        The horizontal position of the survey aircraft used to collect
        data was determined by reconciling down-looking photographs
        (recorded on continuous-strip film) with topographic maps
        and orthophotoquadrangle maps.  Fiducial numbers and marks,
        impressed on any paper strips that were recording data or
        added to magnetic tape records, were included
        as a function of time to further reconcile location with
        instrumentation.
    Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:
      Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The aircraft vertical position was determined using the
        navigational positioning equipment on the aircraft, which
        were radar altimeter and barometric altimeter.  Barometric
        altimeter data are not available for most of these data sets.

        Radar altimeters are estimated to have an error
        of 2-5% of the altitude (Richard Hansen, PRJ, Inc.,
        written communication).

        The magnetometer was carried in a bird towed on a
        line that was about 100 feet below the aircraft.
        The bird as it is towed is slightly behind the aircraft
        and therefore the vertical distance between the
        magnetometer and the aircraft is less than the length
        of the line but remains constant for the survey.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Conversion of measured values to geographic position and
        magnetic and radiometric values was performed by the contractor
        using industry standard practices.

        Details are found under Attribute Accuracy Report,
        Horizontal_Position_Accuracy_Report, and
        Vertical_Position_Accuracy_Report

        Conversion processes, if reported, may be found in the
        U.S. Department of Energy's published GJO- or GJBX- reports for the
        quadrangle or group of quadrangles.  Unpublished products generated
        by the contractor included magnetic tapes and perhaps some
        written documentation.

      Process_Description:
        USGS reformatting of contractor data to standard format.

        USGS personnel used the software package Oasis Montaj version 6.3 by
        Geosoft, Inc., to read in the original contractor's data.  Positioning
        and magnetic values were checked for obvious errors or spikes. Values
        of -9999.9,-999.9, -99.9, etc., were given where the value could not be
        reasonably corrected or, in some cases, the whole record was removed.
        Information that was missing from the data file but recorded elsewhere, such
        as year flown, was added th the file. The radiometric data were not checked
        for errors except for dummy values which were replaced with -99.9, -999.9, etc.
        The reformatted data files were written in the format described in the section
        on Entity_and_Attribute_Overview.

    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: totmag
      Attribute_Definition:
        Raw magnetic value with base magnetometer corrections applied.

        Because the magnetic field of the earth varies diurnally,
        a stationary base magnetometer is maintained on the ground
        during airborne surveying.  The base magnetometer records
        changes in the magnetic field (in nanoTeslas) as a function
        of time.  The magnetic changes may have an amplitude of 20
        to 50 nanoTeslas.  If changes are more severe, as would
        occur from a magnetic storm, surveying is discontinued or
        the data recorded are not used.

        Diurnal variations are then removed from the airborne magnetic
        data based on the common time.

        Records containing missing data were usually deleted.

      Attribute_Value_Accuracy_Information:
        Attribute_Value_Accuracy: 2
        Attribute_Value_Accuracy_Explanation:
          The airborne magnetometer is accurate to about 1 nanoTesla,
          and the base magnetometer has the same accuracy.  The accuracy
          of the base-corrected airborne value therefore is near 2 nanoTeslas
          or better.
      Attribute_Measurement_Frequency:
        The magnetometer has a recharging interval of 0.5
        seconds.  The data were recorded at 1 second intervals.
    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: resmag
      Attribute_Definition:
        residual magnetic value

        The total magnetic value minus a geomagnetic reference field (GRF),
        which is a long-wavelength regional magnetic field.  The most commonly
        used reference field is determined from a model developed by the
        International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA).  The
        International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF), is a predictive model
        adopted at the beginning of a model period (e.g. in 1989 for 1990-1995).
        After the model period, a revised definitive model is adopted, the DGRF.
        This is the preferred model to use for removing regional magnetic fields
        for epochs when CM models are not available.

        For this survey, the field removed is IGRF 1975.

        Some contractors add a constant to the residual value in order to
        avoid negative values.  This constant can vary from one data set to
        another.

      Attribute_Value_Accuracy_Information:
        Attribute_Value_Accuracy: 2
        Attribute_Value_Accuracy_Explanation:
          The Geomagnetic Reference Field that was subtracted from
          the total magnetic value is based on a model, which was
          updated to the date of the survey.  New models are
          available at five year intervals.  These models have
          varying degrees of accuracy in determining the local
          reference field.
    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: diurnal
      Attribute_Definition:
        Base magnetometer values used to correct the total magnetic
        value.

        Because the magnetic field of the earth varies diurnally,
        a stationary base magnetometer is maintained on the ground
        during airborne surveying.  The base magnetometer records
        changes in the magnetic field (in nanoTeslas) as a function
        of time called the diurnal.  The magnetic changes may have an
        amplitude of 20 to 50 nanoTeslas.  The diurnal is monitored
        during the survey and if changes are severe, as would
        occur from a magnetic storm, surveying is discontinued or
        the data recorded are not used.

        Diurnal variations are then removed from the airborne magnetic
        data based on the common time.

      Attribute_Label: resmagCM4
      Attribute_Definition:
        The total magnetic field value minus the core component of geomagnetic
        field is known as the comprehensive model (CM). CM4 (the fourth generation
        of CM) is the modern reference field determined from a long-wavelength
        spatially and temporally continuous model of the geomagnetic field that
        simultaneously considers the Earths core, lithospheric, and external
        magnetic fields (external ionospheric and magnetospheric fields and the
        components induced by them inside the Earth). Spherical harmonic degree 13
        of CM4 is the preferred model to use for removing regional magnetic fields
        for the time periods it is valid for (1960 to June 2002).
